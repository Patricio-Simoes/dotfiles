# This is my i3 config master file.

# I have split the config across multiple files, for easier maintenance:

#   "autostart.conf" - Where all the programs that i want to start automatically on boot are called.
#   "keybinds.conf" - This is where the keyboard shortcuts are defined.
#   "monitors.conf" - This is where the xrandr configuration is defined and where i manage multiple outputs.
#   "window.conf" - This is where the border and gaps are defined and also, where the floating rules for some programs are defined.

# In addition, i have created a script that allows me to switch the theme of every program that i use. For example:
# If i want to switch the current theme that rofi, conky and i3 are using, i can just press mod+ctrl+[0-9].
# This would change, for instance, the dracula theme to gruvbox without deleting any files. So you can always switch between them.
# This script is called "theme.sh" and is located in the "scripts/" folder.

# Also, i should mention that, the base for my configs was EndeavourOs's i3 config files.
# I have modified them heavily, but a lot of my work was made possible by those guys!

# Cheers!
